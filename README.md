Just copy plugin you like to Vim plugin directory.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugin
cp ./yaml-tree/yaml-tree.vim ~/.vim/plugin/
```

YAML tree plugin helps me to navigate huge thousands row CI/CD declarations like `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Open YAML file and press `<F5>`, choose root item you want to jump and press `<ENTER>`.
